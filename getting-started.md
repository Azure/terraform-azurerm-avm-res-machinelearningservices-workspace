Overview

This guide provides a detailed step-by-step process for using a Terraform module from scratch. It includes instructions for installation, cloning the repository, executing Terraform scripts from examples, and using different combinations of optional variables. This documentation assumes a basic understanding of Terraform and its components.

Prerequisites
Terraform Installed: Ensure that Terraform is installed on your system. You can download it from the Terraform website.

Version Control System (Git): Make sure Git is installed for cloning repositories. Download Git from the official website if it's not installed.

Azure Account: Have an subscription with Azure.


Step 1: Installation

Install Terraform
1. Download Terraform:
 - Navigate to the Terraform download page.
 - Choose the appropriate version for your operating system.

2. Install Terraform:
 - Windows: Extract the downloaded zip file and place the executable in a directory included in your system's PATH.
 - macOS: Use Homebrew to install Terraform: brew install terraform.
 - Linux: Extract the downloaded archive and move the executable to /usr/local/bin or another directory in your PATH.

3. Verify Installation:
 - Run terraform -version in your terminal to ensure Terraform is installed correctly.


Step 2: Clone the Repository
To use a Terraform module, you first need to clone the repository that contains the module.

1. Clone the Repository:

 - Use Git to clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Azure/terraform-azurerm-avm-res-machinelearningservices-workspace.git
```

2. Navigate to the Module Directory:

 - Change into the directory containing the Terraform module:

```bash
cd terraform-azurerm-avm-res-machinelearningservices-workspace
```

Step 3: Configure Terraform
Initialize the Terraform Working Directory

1. Initialize Terraform:
 - Run terraform init in the module directory. This command initializes the working directory containing the Terraform configuration files:
```
terraform init
```

Configure Backend (Optional):

If your project requires a specific backend like Azure Blob Storage for state management, configure it in a backend.tf.

Step 4: Getting started with Examples
The examples folder demonstrate how to use the module with various configurations and variable combinations.

1. Navigate to the examples Directory:

If your module repository has an examples directory, navigate to it. It has multiple examples that demonstrate different configurations and use cases. You can start with the default example or choose one that best fits your requirements:

```bash
cd examples/default
```

2. Review Example Configurations:

Open the example configuration files (e.g., main.tf) to understand how the module is used and which variables are set.

3. Customize the Example:

Edit the example files to suit your specific needs. Otherwise, use it as-is. All examples has variables.tf file that lists all the variables you can set and they are already set with default values.


Step 5: (Optional) Advance Configuration

Required Variables
1. Identify Required Variables:

Review the module documentation or variables.tf file to identify required variables.
2. Set Required Variables:

You can set variables using a terraform.tfvars file, environment variables, or directly in your command line. For example:

```bash
export TF_VAR_variable_name="value"
```

or create a terraform.tfvars file with the required variables in one of the examples directory:

```bash
variable_name = "value"
```

Optional Variables
1. Default Values:
 - Optional variables usually have default values specified in the variables.tf file.

2. Override Defaults:
 - You can override optional variables in the same way as required variables if you need different configurations.


Step 6: Execute Terraform Scripts
Plan
1. Generate an Execution Plan:
 - Run terraform plan to create an execution plan. This command shows what actions Terraform will take to reach the desired state:
```bash
terraform plan -out=tfplan
```

2. Review the Plan:
 - Carefully review the plan output. Ensure that the proposed changes match your expectations.

Apply
1. Apply the Plan:
 - If the plan is correct, apply it to provision the resources:
```bash
terraform apply tfplan
```

2. Confirm Changes:
 - Confirm the changes if prompted. Terraform will then execute the actions to reach the desired state.

Step 7: Managing State and Outputs
State Management

1. View State:
 - Use terraform state list to view the resources managed by Terraform.

2. State Files:
 - State is stored in terraform.tfstate. Ensure it is secured and backed up, as it contains sensitive information.

Outputs
1. View Outputs:
 - Outputs from your Terraform configuration can be viewed using:
```bash
terraform output
```

2. Define Outputs:
 - Define outputs in your configuration to access important information, like IP addresses or resource IDs.


Using Different Combinations of Optional Variables

Explore Combinations
1. Review Variable Combinations:
 - Experiment with different combinations of optional variables by adjusting the values in terraform.tfvars or through command-line arguments.

2. Test and Validate:
 - After setting up different variable combinations, always run terraform plan and terraform apply to test and validate the configurations.


Best Practices

 - Always use version constraints when referencing modules to ensure consistency and prevent unexpected changes.
 - Keep sensitive information out of your Terraform configurations. Use environment variables or secure secret management solutions.
 - Use consistent formatting in your Terraform files. The terraform fmt command can help with this.
 - Write clear and concise comments in your Terraform configurations to explain complex logic or important decisions.
 - Regularly update your modules and provider versions to benefit from bug fixes and new features.


Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues while using the module:

 - Ensure all required variables are set correctly.
 - Check that you're using a compatible version of Terraform and the required providers.
 - Review the module's documentation for any specific requirements or known issues.
- Use terraform validate to check for configuration errors.
 - If you're getting unexpected results, use terraform console to inspect and debug values.

For persistent issues, consult the module's issue tracker or reach out to the maintainers for support.
